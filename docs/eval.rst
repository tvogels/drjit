Evaluation
==========

The previous sections explained how Dr.Jit traces computation for later
evaluation. We now examine what situations trigger this evaluation step,
potential performance pitfalls related to evaluation, and how to take manual
control if needed.

Why?
----

Certain operations simply cannot be traced. When Dr.Jit encounters them in a
program, it forces the system to compile and run a kernel before continuing.

The following operations all exhibit this behavior:

1. **Printing the contents of arrays**.

   Printing requires knowing the actual array contents at that moment, hence
   evaluation can no longer be postponed. Here is an example:

   .. code-block:: python

      a = Float(1, 2) + 3 # <-- traced
      print(a)            # <-- evaluated

   (Dr.Jit offers an alternative :py:func:`drjit.print()` statement that can
   print in a delayed fashion to be compatible with tracing.)

2. **Accessing arrays along their trailing dimension**.

   Recall that the trailing dimension of Jit-compiled arrays plays a special
   role, as the system uses it to parallelize the computation. Accessing a
   specific entries or gathering along this dimension creates a data dependency
   that cannot be satisfied within the same parallel phase. An example:

   .. code-block:: python

      a = Float(1, 2) + 3 # <-- traced
      b = a[0]            # <-- evaluates
      dr.gather(Float, source=a, index=UInt32(0)) # <-- this as well

   Dr.Jit will split such programs into multiple kernels, which it eagerly does
   by evaluating the source array whenever it detects this type of access.

   Note that it is specifically the trailing dimension that causes this
   behavior. For example, accesses to components of a nested array type like
   :py:class:`drjit.cuda.Array3f` are unproblematic and can be traced.

   .. code-block:: python

      a = Array3f(1, 2, 3) + 4 <-- traced
      b = a[0] + a.y           <-- traced

3. **Side effects**:

   Operations such as :py:func:`drjit.scatter`,
   :py:func:`drjit.scatter_reduce`, etc., modify existing arrays. While such
   operations are traced (i.e. postponed for later evaluation), subsequent
   access of the modified array triggers a variable evaluation. An example:

   .. code-block:: python

      a = dr.empty(Float, 3)
      dr.scatter(target=a, value=Float(0, 1, 2), index=UInt32(2, 1, 0))
      b = a + 1 # <-- evaluated

   Here, evaluation enforces an ordering constraint that is in general needed
   to ensure correctness in a parallel execution context.

4. **Data exchange**: Casting Dr.Jit variables into nd-arrays of other
   frameworks (e.g. NumPy, PyTorch, etc.) requires evaluation since these
   libraries cannot represent traced computation.

5. **Manual**:

   Variable evaluation can also be triggered *manually* using the operation
   :py:func:`drjit.eval()`:

   .. code-block:: python

      dr.eval(a)

What happens when Dr.Jit evaluates a variable?

TODO:

- Careful with indexing (reading/writing scalars)
- Taking control: Evaluate multiple things at once
- Kernel caching
